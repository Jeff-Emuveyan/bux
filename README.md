# Bux - technical assignment solution

This application helps users track the prices of products in real time. It displays an inteface that shows the user the current price of a product, the previous closing 
price of the product and the percentage increase or decrease of the product.

The **first screen** shows a list of predefined products. It also allows the user type in any product identifier and search for it by clicking on the search button.

The **second screen** shows the real time price values for the product. If the product has increased in value, a green arrow is shown. If not, a red arrow is shown.
